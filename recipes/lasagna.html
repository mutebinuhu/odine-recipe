    <h3>Steps Taken to make a lasagna dish</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large frying pan. Add onion and garlic and cook for 5 minutes, until softened, then add mince and brown well. Pour in the tomatoes and sprinkle over the dried oregano. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for 10 -15 minutes, until thickened. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 180 C. Grease a medium oven proof baking dish. Line base with ¼ of the lasagna sheets, trimming to fit if necessary. Spoon 1/3 or the mince mixture over the lasagna, cover with a generous layer of béchamel sauce.</li>
        <li>
            Repeat the layering twice. Cover béchamel with a layer of lasagna sheets, and spread over the remaining béchamel. Sprinkle over the cheese and bake for 30-40 minutes, until the pasta is tender and cheese is golden brown. Cover with foil if necessary during baking, to prevent cheese from burning.
